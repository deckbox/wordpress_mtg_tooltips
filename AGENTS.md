Add the most simple and minimal implementation of the requested features and fixes.
No placeholder code for future that is not specifically necessary NOW.
No README or docs unless explicitly required.
Use very minimal comments in the code, only around complicated sections.

Tests should be run to confirm changes with `composer test`.
